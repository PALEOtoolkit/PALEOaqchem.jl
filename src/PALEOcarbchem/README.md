Carbonate chemistry equilibrium originally based on Matlab CO2SYS v1.1 (van Heuven et al 2011, Lewis and Wallace 1998) and refactored for speed and extensibility.

## Differences from CO2SYS-MATLAB
- Refactored for speed, to allow use in numerical models.
- Based on an older (2011) version 1.1 of CO2SYS Matlab
- Uses CO2SYS Matlab equilibrium constants, with a reimplemented equilibrium calculation. NB: Although constants can be calculated for different pH scales, TAlk or pH calculations require constants to be on free pH scale.
- H2S and NH3 added from Hofman etal (2010)
