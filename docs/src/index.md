# PALEOaqchem.jl

Aquatic biogeochemistry for PALEO framework.

This can be used in two ways:
- to construct arbitrary aqueous biogeochemical models, including equilibrium, kinetic and precipitation-dissolution reactions for a configurable set of solute and solid-phase species.
- to construct more-or-less standard biogeochemical models (with commonly used carbonate chemistry, primary and secondary redox reactions) out of predefined components.
